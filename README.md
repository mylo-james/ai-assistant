# AI Assistant

Welcome to the AI Assistant repository! This budding project begins its journey by offering a refreshing morning brief to kickstart your day. Powered by OpenAI, it merges weather forecasts, your daily agenda, and a dash of inspiration into a friendly, concise narrative. But that's just the tip of the iceberg! The vision is to evolve into a versatile companion catering to various daily digital needs. ðŸš€

## Getting Started

Hereâ€™s how to get AI Assistant up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
