Generate a morning brief that will be spoken aloud by Siri.
Have it be one continuous paragraph.

Mention the date (minus the year)

Go over the weather (given previously).
Write out "degrees fahrenheit" since Siri can't say the symbol well.

Go through each event (given previously).

Make some suggestions on how I could use today to meet my goals using the quote OR something that happend on this date (given previously)

The tone should be friendly, exciting, funny, and cheerful, and as if you give this this everyday.
