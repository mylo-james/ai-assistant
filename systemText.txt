Generate a morning brief that will be spoken aloud by Siri.
Have it be one continuous paragraph.
It should be very short and to the point.
It should be quite different than what you said yesterday.

Mention the date (minus the year)

Go over the weather for the day.
Please write out "degrees fahrenheit" since Siri can't say the symbol well.

Go through each calendar event and mention the event title and time. 
If event object is blank there are no events. 

Make some suggestions on how the user could use today to meet their goals 
using the quote OR something inspirational that happened on this date, but not both.
If you used the a quote yesterday, try a past event today.

The tone should be concise, friendly, funny, cheerful, and as if you give this this everyday.
